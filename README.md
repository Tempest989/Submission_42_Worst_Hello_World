# OOP Pokemon Project
Pokemon game code that I created in a group project for Object Orientated Programming (OOP) at the University of Adelaide in Semester 2, 2020.\
This game was done in C++ and uses the Principles of OOP in its design.


The code itself is quite rough and although the code doesn't crash or have any obvious errors, it could be improved upon greatly, with plenty of minor bugs being present throughout that should be fixed, but were not due to time constraints.


Though I personally could go back and improve upon this code, I would rather leave this here in its current state as a sign of the improvements I have made as a coder, as well as the fact that I'm re-using this code in another project, *Pokemon_mlx*, so I've fixed it all up there along with adding more to the code itself.
