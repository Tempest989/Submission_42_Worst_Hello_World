About this thing?:

Basically is 3 games run in a gaunlet format, bet all 3 in a row, you win, and then hopefully hello world is printed of course.

all the games should be smooth and not many bugs, the last game (3rd one) might have a few hiccups maybe but should be alright, only had it crash once out of about 30 test runs

WARNING: If this is run through an actual linux computer terminal, whether its a proper linux computer or a virtualbox, it should work fine
BUT if its not, then I cannot guarentee this will run, as in my personal experiences, sometimes the terminal conks out in online IDE or environments
it could have just been the one I was using (which was CS50 IDE by the way), but the point still stands.

If there are any major progression bugs that do not work, checked Gaunlet.cpp and Controller.cpp since they are the progession pieces, if its specially game related,
whether its results or something look through the specific game files, which are all listed in the "Makefile", with each sort into games


HOW TO RUN IT:
Type "make" into the terminal and it should compile without errors, hopefully.

Then if you wish to run the gaunlet, type "./gaunlet" to get started 
if U wish to play the other games seperately of the gaunlet, each of they call executions are lited in the "Makefile" by typing "./" and then the word written after the "-o" in the Makefile

If you have any further questions or major bugs that need fixing, feel free to throw me a message on Discord @Kocatwo and thanks for Playing this, thing?


TESTING:

Each of the games has been exhaustively tested and work fine on their own without many, if any, bugs
but due to time constraints running the whole thing was not tested much so some connecting bugs of the games may occur, sorry ran out to time to do most of this in 4 days.
