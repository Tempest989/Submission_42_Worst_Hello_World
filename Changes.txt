Pokemon:
BLissey (soft boiled,thunderbolt,ice beam, light screen)
shedinja (maybe change moves?)
Dracovish (already fine, maybe give move other than brine?)
lapras (all good, maybe change moves, change rest to protect)
gyarados (ice fang, aqua tail, earthquake, dragon dance)
snorlax (return, rest, sleep talk, earthquake)
add more pokemon....

gengar (protect, shadow ball, sludge bomb, destiny bond)
Corviknight (iron head, brave bird, drill peck, roost)
braviery (hone claws, roost, brave bird, return)

Steven Changes:
Update AI to always go for kills when they see it
Update AI so it only damage calcs multiplier of power dmg, not actual damage output
Fix Switch so only done if opponent is 2X or more effectiveness in typing, unless low on hp then sack it
Switch cradily or someone else for dragonite (changed to add dragonite as boss at the end if there is time)
Change it so he uses items, not sure if he ever has so make sure he can

Overall Changes:
Update so earthquake hits dugged player for 2X damage
Implement all moves for new pokemon
Once done, tidy up code for stuff that is not required for all the implemented pokemon (if enough time, probs not, maybe only all the extra moves if there is a lot left unused)
Implement natures to pokemon and add ev/iv to player pokemon upon creation (need to decide how many to add)
make UI look smoother and spaced out more
Fix some bugs (if possible, fine if buggy since adds to the charm)


whats left: 
abilities new pokemon (done)
make ui better (spacing of stuff, change enemy mentions to Steven since he IS the enemy DUH)
bug test (oh fuck me sideways)
add natures? depends on balancing side of things and time of course (no time, player already op af)
update players stuff (items less like enemy....... or ITEMLESS!!! (IM AN AKUMA))

DESTINY BOND FORGOT TO IMPLEMENT!!! (should be good)
Fix recoil not based of damage power only damage dealt  (should work)
fix protect, goes on 1 turn too long (looks fine?)
sleep talk doesn't work through sleep  (should work, not an elegant solution at all)
need to put text for can't attack through sleep (???)
put text for when steven heals  (done and done)
had weird bug of hyper potion healing 50 odd (wack) (see if it pops up again)
skarymary spikes are not working, only using spikes  (if ive got time ill check it out)
spikes do not work at all, maybe cause of 0,1,3, thing amke 3 to 3+ (^^^)
confuse check needs to be after first attack is done, incase confuse is done first turn  (should be fixed hopefully)
move check stats of pokemon option to after everything is displayed  (should be all G)
mix up who starts for steven  (should be all g)
edit players items/pokemon they can have (done items, teams should be done too)
make players name pop up more instead of player  (if time once its all set up)
roost should error when being used at full hp, like all other hp increase moves, implement that  (should be all g)

say when dead to confusion, do not get turn if died, implement confusion timer (pretty sure its all g now with the above confuse fix)


sleep talk does not work need to fix
roost is op as shit, acts as protect since damage no work at all


include flinch if time if not its all g
flinch and sleep talk left, confuse ray is dodgy but that fine, adds to the charm in my opinion
also has crashed once, no idea y has not crashed since idk, good luck?
